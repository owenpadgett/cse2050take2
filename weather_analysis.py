# Instructions:
# 1. **Remove the TODO comment and pass statement** once you’ve completed the function implementation.
#    - The TODO and pass are placeholders indicating that the function is not yet complete.
#    - Once the function is implemented, these should be removed to keep the code clean.
# 
# 2. **Best Coding Practices**:
#    - In professional programming, finalizing the code means removing unnecessary placeholders.
#    - This ensures your code is ready for review, testing, and does not contain clutter.
# 
# 3. **Adding Docstrings**:
#    - After removing TODO and pass, add a **docstring** for each function.
#    - The docstring should explain the function’s purpose, parameters, and expected output.
#    - Proper documentation improves code readability and helps with debugging and maintenance.
